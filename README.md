- Explored the structure and function of Trypsin using UniProt and PDB.
- Performed sequence and structure similarity searches.
- Visualized and aligned protein structures using PyMol.
- Implemented sequence and structural distance functions in Python.
- Benchmarked protein sets for sequence and structure similarity.

### **HW2: Protein Structure Prediction**

- Predicted structures for proteins using AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3, and RosettaFold.
- Generated pLDDT and PAE charts to evaluate model performance.
- Aligned predicted structures with experimental ones and compared key differences.
- Investigated the prediction of ECORI with and without DNA binding sites.

### **HW3: Binder Design with BindCraft and Chai-1**

- Used BindCraft to design binders for the BHRF1 protein targeting specific hotspots.
- Validated binders using Chai-1 and compared predicted structures.
- Evaluated in-silico success metrics such as RMSD, Binding Energy, SASA, and pLDDT.
- Visualized passing and non-passing binders to analyze performance differences.

### **HW4: Protein Design with RFDiffusion**

- Generated protein designs using RFDiffusion, including symmetric homo-trimers and motif scaffolds.
- Visualized alpha-helix fractions and compared scaffolds with partial diffusion outputs.
- Designed and evaluated binders for IL-7RÎ±, optimizing hotspots and structural stability.
